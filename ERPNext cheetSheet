How to reset Database:
  Any and all bench commands need to be performed as the erp user (e.g. erpnext) 
  and executed in the bench directory (e.g. frappe-bench). Don't use sudo as this will 
  cause issues as well. Instead sudo su to the erp user. e.g.
  
    myregularuser@host:~$ sudo su - erpnext
    erpnext@host:~$ cd frappe-bench
    erpnext@host:~/frappe-bench$ bench reinstall
    erpnext@host:~/frappe-bench$ bench mysql
